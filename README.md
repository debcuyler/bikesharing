# Bikesharing
## Overview
This challenge tasked us with finding answers to questions that investors may have about a potential bike sharing program in Des Moines. The data used is from August of 2018 in New York City, with the Citi Bike bike sharing program. The presentation is designed to show investors that a ride sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Several visualizations were created, along with a story, using Tableau Public so that presentation to potential investors is clear and concise.

## Summary
In summary, our graphs show that males use the bike share program much more than females, peak rental times are weekdays from 6am to 9am and 4pm and 9pm. These times might possibly be due to ride sharing being utilized to get back and forth to work. On the weekend, the rental rates are pretty stable through the hours of 9am to 9pm. There is an increased amount of usage in Manhattan, where this could be explained by tourist use or by the daily communting of locals. We do see on our graphs that the user type of 'Subscriber' rides the majority of the time.

If I were the one wanting to start this business in Des Moines, I would want to know the profit margin of this business. There is quite a bit of expense for the bikes, maintenance of the bikes and the bike stations. I would also want some basic data on the Des Moines area. There is not much comparison to NYC, I would want to know how the city commutes, do they drive, ride bikes, take public transportation, etc... How much tourist activity is in Des Moines that may support the 'Customer' user type.
