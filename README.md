# Bikesharing
## Overview
This challenge tasked us with finding answers to questions that investors may have about a potential bike sharing program in Des Moines. The data used is from August of 2018 in New York City, with the Citi Bike bike sharing program. The presentation is designed to show investors that a ride sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Several visualizations were created, along with a story, using Tableau Public so that presentation to potential investors is clear and concise.
## Results
 - Checkout times for users - this graph can be filtered by each hour of the day. This shows investors the times of the day that ride sharing is utilized the most
 
 - Checkout times for users by gender - this graph can be filtered by each hour of the day as well as by gender. This expands on the graph above by breaking it down by gender
 
 - This heatmap shows the trips by weekday per hour. The legend shows that areas of dark red are peak trip times
 
 - This heatmap shows the trips by weekday per hour by gender. Dark red shows peak times and the map is fiterable by gender

 - This map shows the top starting locations for bike rentals. Likely, the high concentration in Manhattan is due to tourist activity. The darker and larger the circle, the more riders started at that point
 
 - This heat map shows the number of bikes in service and how many times each has been ridden. This helps pinpoint bikes that may need service soon. The darker the color, the more the bike has been ridden
 
 
## Summary
In summary, our graphs show that males use the bike share program much more than females, peak rental times are weekdays from 6am to 9am and 4pm and 9pm. These times might possibly be due to ride sharing being utilized to get back and forth to work. On the weekend, the rental rates are pretty stable through the hours of 9am to 9pm. There is an increased amount of usage in Manhattan, where this could be explained by tourist use or by the daily communting of locals. We do see on our graphs that the user type of 'Subscriber' rides the majority of the time.

If I were the one wanting to start this business in Des Moines, I would want to know the profit margin of this business. There is quite a bit of expense for the bikes, maintenance of the bikes and the bike stations. I would also want some basic data on the Des Moines area. There is not much comparison to NYC, I would want to know how the city commutes, do they drive, ride bikes, take public transportation, etc... How much tourist activity is in Des Moines that may support the 'Customer' user type.
